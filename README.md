# custome-api

1. ## Application description:

I beleive that everyone would value having reminder messages desinged to cultivate mindsets that are customized to their personal needs.

CustoME is an app focused on mental health, where the user can create messages that are entirely customized by the user.

I've always wanted to integrate my background in psychology and my personal interest in the importance of maintaining one selves wellbeing with tech. The level of freedom offered by this project, gives me the opportunity to explore my ideas viability.

2. ## Project Planning

  I began by making the ERD, user stories, and the Wireframes. Afterwards, I jotted down all the routes that I will need for the resource(s) that I would be building out. I then created a timeline of what I needed to complete by when, making sure to incude buffer time zomes for debugging errors that would come up along the way. I tackeled errors and problems that arose by googleing the various error messages I received and by refering to the documentation of the particular technology I was utelizing. I also made sure to reach out to my fellow cohort members and the instructors for additional aid if my personal efforts were futile.
